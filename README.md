# LocalHW

Picture this. It's near the end of a lesson. Your teacher isn't very tech-savvy. They tell the class, "You all have homework to do. You have to complete 3 pages on pages 33-36 of the textbook. I won't be setting tasks on the school's tasks system, because you need to learn to remember on your own. Anyone who doesn't do the homework will face my wrath."

You know you aren't going to remember. You know you don't want to face his wrath. And you need to log it fast, before any unnecessary suspicion is caused.
So you need to get to a place where you can quickly add a task in a few seconds so that you don't attract any attention from teachers or students. That's where LocalHW comes in.

## Why LocalHW?
Because it's one of the fastest (if not THE fastest) ways to be able to remind yourself of a task.
We have:
- No signups required to set a task! This is probably the thing that makes it faster than anything you'd use.
- Lightweight and simple! You literally fill out three text fields and click a button. That's 4 clicks and around 10 seconds of typing.
- Secure and private! All data is stored locally on your device. (Don't clear your cache until you've finished your HW!) I might add an export feature in future, but it won't be required to use.
- Free and [open source](LICENSE)! ...although given you're here you already know that, don't you?

## Plans for the future
I am planning to maybe in more sort/filter options and ways to find a task.
I _might_ add cloud saving (but do not worry, this is opt-in only). No signup will be required though, and for guest users it will still be a fast experience using `localStorage` on your local browser. This is only here as a more persistent alternative for people who are cautious about their disk space.

## Open Source
Yeah I already said this. It's open-source (under MIT).

## Contributing
The more the merrier! If you want to contribute, simply fork the repository and submit a pull request.
